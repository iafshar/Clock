# Clock

A clock is a unique way of visualizing music. It uses a metronome that continuously spins around a circle with one point being fixed in the center. You can then add percussive sounds anywhere in the circle and when the metronome hits them, the sounds are played. The image below demonstrates how it looks. A red mini circle would represent the sound of a snare, a pink one would represent the sound of a kick, and a dark grey one would represent the sound of a hi hat.

You can also change the tempo of your clock which would affect the speed at which the metronome spins. You can do this by dragging the slider at the bottom of the screen horizontally, or you can click on the keypad image in the top left corner which will take you to the page shown below.

Here you can manually set the tempo by clicking on the number keys on the screen or by using the number keys on your keyboard. You can also, periodically click on the button saying "click" and the tempo will be set to the tempo at which you are clicking.


This is a social media site built around clocks. It allows you to create different types of accounts, create clocks and share them with other accounts. In the same vein as Instagram, it allows you to like and comment on other clocks, follow other accounts, and it also offers a page designed specifically for you to see the most popular clocks.

This uses a MySQL database and currently only runs on localhost.
