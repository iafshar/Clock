# Clock

A clock is a unique way of visualizing music. It uses a metronome that continuously spins around a circle with one point being fixed in the center. You can then add percussive sounds anywhere in the circle and when the metronome hits them, the sounds are played.

This system allows you to create different types of accounts, create clocks and share them with other accounts. In the same vein as Instagram, it allows you to like and comment on other clocks, follow other accounts, and it also offers a page designed specifically for you to see the most popular clocks.

This uses a MySQL database.
